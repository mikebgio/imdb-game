# imdb-game
Web version of Nick Martucci's Inappropriate Movie Database gameshow

A game where players are presented with a release year and a series of 
real posts from IMDB's parental guide section as the only clues to guess 
the name of a movie. The earlier you guess correctly, the more points you earn.
